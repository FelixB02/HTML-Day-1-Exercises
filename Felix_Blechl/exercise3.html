        <p> <span><b>It's early morning,</b></span> <span>the sun comes out</span> <br>
            Last night was shaking and pretty loud<br>
            My cat is purring, it scratches my skin<br>
            So what is wrong with another sin?</p>
            <p><span><b>The bitch is hungry,</b></span> she needs to tell<br>
                So give her inches and feed her well<br>
                More days to come, new places to go<br>
                I've got to leave, it's time for a show</p>
                
    </div>
        <p>Here I am<br>
        Rock you like a hurricane<br>
        Here I am<br>
